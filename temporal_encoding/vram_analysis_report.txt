VRAM Growth Analysis Report
===========================

Sources:
- vram_benchmark_report.txt
- vram_absolute_report.txt

Baseline (model weights): 7.10 GB

Benchmark Growth (streaming @1 fps, up to T=30s):
- Peak: 8.95 GB
- Avg growth (first-last): 0.0417 GB/s
- Linear regression slope: 0.0413 GB/s

Absolute-Time Growth (streaming @1 fps, up to T=20s):
- Peak: 10.31 GB
- Avg growth (first-last): 0.0913 GB/s
- Linear regression slope: 0.0924 GB/s

Ask() Memory Spike:
- Before/After ask() remained essentially unchanged in both runs (≤0.01 GB), indicating negligible spike.

Projection (based on linear regression slope):
Assuming usable VRAM = Total VRAM - 7.10 GB baseline

24 GB GPU:
- Available: 16.90 GB
- Benchmark slope: 16.90 / 0.0413 ≈ 409 s ≈ 6.8 min
- Absolute-time slope: 16.90 / 0.0924 ≈ 183 s ≈ 3.1 min

40 GB GPU:
- Available: 32.90 GB
- Benchmark slope: 32.90 / 0.0413 ≈ 797 s ≈ 13.3 min
- Absolute-time slope: 32.90 / 0.0924 ≈ 356 s ≈ 5.9 min

Notes:
- Growth rate varies with scene complexity and frame content; use the absolute-time slope as a conservative estimate.
- Per-second curves are recorded in the two source reports above.
