TTFT Analysis Report (benchmark_video_stream.py)
================================================

Run Summary:
- Checkpoints: T=5s, T=10s, T=30s
- TTFTs: 0.088s, 0.074s, 0.103s
- Average TTFT: 0.088s

How TTFT is calculated in code:
- In `VideoStreamingInference.ask()`, TTFT is defined as the elapsed wall time from the start of the `ask()` call to the moment the first token is generated.
- The code captures `t_start = time.time()` immediately after optional CUDA synchronization.
- It runs the prefill pass (question encoding with KV cache), then performs the first decode step (one token generation).
- After the first token is produced, it synchronizes CUDA again and captures `t_first_token = time.time()`.
- TTFT is computed as `t_first_token - t_start` and returned in `metrics['ttft']`.

Detailed Stats:
- Min TTFT: 0.074s (T=10s)
- Max TTFT: 0.103s (T=30s)
- Range: 0.029s

Observations:
- TTFT is consistently < 0.11s across all checkpoints.
- Later timestamp (T=30s) shows a slight increase, likely due to longer KV cache and higher memory footprint.
- No outliers or spikes; stability indicates good prefill+first-token performance under streaming cache growth.

Conclusion:
- TTFT KPI (<1.0s) is comfortably met with large safety margin.
