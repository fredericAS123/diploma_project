Analysis Summary
Based on Qwen2.5-VL's mRoPE design, position IDs for visual tokens are assigned in a temporal-spatial grid. When multiple images are provided in a single prompt, the visual token blocks typically share a continuous sequence, so the Temporal (T) index tends to advance across images. When images are processed independently, each call starts its own sequence, so T indices usually reset for each image. Use the ranges above to confirm whether T is continuous in Experiment A and reset in Experiment B.
